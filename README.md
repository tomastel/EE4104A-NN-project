# [EE4104A Project: Artificial Neural Network](http://www.ee.polyu.edu.hk/pdf/syllabus/BEng/EE4014A.pdf)
*Mini-project in the course EE4014A at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/)*

As a part of my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, I spent one semester abroad in Hong Kong in the autumn of 2021.

This individual project was a mandatory part of an introductory course in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The project consisted of programming a multi-layer neural network using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and training the network through supervised learning.

I decided to train my network to recognize a wine's region of origin based on 13 attributes, using an open-source dataset found online. Further work consisted of testing the network with different parameters, and analyzing its accuracy.
