# [EE4104A Project: Artificial Neural Network](http://www.ee.polyu.edu.hk/pdf/syllabus/BEng/EE4014A.pdf)
*Mini-project in the course EE4014A at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/)*

As a part of my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, I spent one semester abroad in Hong Kong in the autumn of 2021.

This individual project was a mandatory part of an introduction course in artificial intelligence. The project consisted of programming a multi-layer neural network using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), a widely used open-source platform for **machine learning**.
